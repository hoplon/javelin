# Javelin

Spreadsheet-like Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) in ClojureScript.

_This library is usable but under construction and subject to frequent
change._

### Example

```clojure
(ns your-ns
  (:require tailrecursion.javelin) ;; necessary if compiling in advanced mode
  (:require-macros [tailrecursion.javelin.macros :refer [cell cell=]]))

(defn start []
  (let [a (cell 0)              ;; input cell with initial value of 0.
        b (cell= (inc a))       ;; formula cell of a+1.
        c (cell= (+ 123 a b))]  ;; formula cell of a+b+123.
    (cell= (.log js/console c)) ;; anonymous formula cell for side effects.
    ;; c's initial value, 124, is printed.
    (swap! a inc)
    ;; a was incremented, and its new value propagated (consistently)
    ;; through b and c.  c's new value, 126, is printed to the console.
    ))
```

### Dependency [![Build Status][1]][2]

```clojure
[tailrecursion/javelin "2.0.0-SNAPSHOT"]
```

### Demos and Examples

For short usage examples, see the [Javelin Demos][3] repository. You may see
some version of these demos running [here][4].

Javelin is also used in two [TodoFRP][5] implementations:

* [Javelin with Domina and Dommy][6]
* [Javelin with Hlisp][7]

## Overview

Javelin provides a spreadsheet-like computing environment consisting
of **cells**, **values**, and **formulas**. Cells are similar to
Clojure atoms: they contain values, they can be dereferenced with
`deref` or the `@` reader macro, and their contents are mutated using
the `swap!` and `reset!` core functions. Formulas are ClojureScript
expressions that may contain references to cells.

### Input Cells and Formula Cells

**Input cells** contain values that are updated explicitly using
`reset!` or `swap!`. **Formula cells** contain values that are
recomputed by Javelin whenever the values in the cells referenced in
the formula expression are changed.

The `cell` macro creates input cells, and the `cell=` macro creates
formula cells.

```clojure
(def a (cell 42))               ;; cell containing the number 42
(def b (cell '(+ 1 2)))         ;; cell containing the list (+ 1 2)
(def c (cell (+ 1 2)))          ;; cell containing the number 3
(def d (cell {:x @a}))          ;; cell containing the map {:x 42}

(def e (cell= {:x a}))          ;; cell with formula {:x a}, updated when a changes
(def f (cell= (+ a 1)))         ;; cell with formula (+ a 1), updated when a changes
(def g (cell= (+ a ~(inc @a)))) ;; cell with formula (+ a 43), updated when a changes

(cell= (.log js/console a))     ;; value of a is printed whenever it's updated

(reset! a 7)                    ;; ok, because a is an input cell
(swap! f inc)                   ;; no! f is a formula cell, it updates itself!
```

### Cell Macro Internals

The `cell` and `cell=` macros create cells using the underlying
`input` and `lift` functions. The former returns an input cell with
the given initial value. The latter "lifts" a given function,
returning a function that, when applied to arguments (which may be
cells) returns a cell with the given function as the formula
&mdash; this cell's value is recomputed whenever any of the
argument cells change.

```clojure
(def x (input 7))       ;; input cell with initial value 7
(def y ((lift +) x 1))  ;; equivalent to (def y (cell= (+ x 1)))
```

To create a formula cell, the `cell=` macro fully macroexpands the
given expression and then walks it, recursively lifting all forms in
function position. However, there are several special cases and
exceptions:

* **Special forms** are replaced with equivalent function
  implementations.
* **Collection literals** are replaced with their sexp equivalents
  and then walked.
* **Anonymous function bodies** are not walked.
* **Quoted expressions** are not walked.
* **The unquote form** causes its argument to be evaluated in place
  and not walked.
* **The unquote-splicing form** is interpreted as the composition
  of `unquote` and `deref`.

### Special Forms In Formulas

The spreadsheet evaluation model is a push-based system, very
different from the usual, pull-based Lisp evaluation model. In Lisp,
forms are evaluated only as needed to produce a value. This model
supports special forms and macros, which decide when to evaluate their
own arguments. In the Javelin evaluation model this is impossible
because formula cells are re-computed _reactively_ based on the values
of the argument cells (cells the formula cell depends on), which must
therefore be computed first.

This causes the behavior of "short-circuiting" expressions like `and`
and `if` to be strange. If the short-circuiting behavior is required
then the expression must be wrapped in an anonymous function:

```clojure
(def x (cell 1))
(def y (cell 1))

;; This cell prints both "even" and "odd"
(cell= (if (even? (+ x y)) (.log js/console "even") (.log js/console "odd")))

;; This cell only prints "even" or "odd"
(cell= (#(if (even? (+ %1 %2)) (.log js/console "even") (.log js/console "odd")) x y))
```
