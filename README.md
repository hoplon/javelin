# Javelin

Spreadsheet-like dataflow programming in ClojureScript.

### Example

```clojure
(ns your-ns
  (:require [tailrecursion.javelin :refer [cell]])
  (:require-macros [tailrecursion.javelin :refer [cell=]]))

(defn start []
  (let [a (cell 0)              ;; input cell with initial value of 0.
        b (cell= (inc a))       ;; formula cell of a+1.
        c (cell= (+ 123 a b))]  ;; formula cell of a+b+123.
    (cell= (.log js/console c)) ;; anonymous formula cell for side effects.
    ;; c's initial value, 124, is printed.
    (swap! a inc)
    ;; a was incremented, and its new value propagated (consistently)
    ;; through b and c.  c's new value, 126, is printed to the console.
    ))
```

## Overview

Javelin provides a spreadsheet-like computing environment consisting
of **input cells** and **formula cells** and introduces the `Cell`
reference type to represent both.

##### All Cells

* contain values.
* implement the `IWatchable` interface.
* are dereferenced with `deref` or the `@` reader macro. 

##### Input Cells

* are created by the `cell` function or `defc` macro.
* are updated explicitly using `swap!` or `reset!`.

##### Formula Cells

* are created by the `cell=` or `defc=` macros.
* are updated _reactively_ according to a formula.
* are read-only&mdash;updating a formula cell via `swap!` or `reset!`
  is an error.

Some examples of cells:

```clojure
(defc a 42)               ;; cell containing the number 42
(defc b '(+ 1 2))         ;; cell containing the list (+ 1 2)
(defc c (+ 1 2))          ;; cell containing the number 3
(defc d {:x @a})          ;; cell containing the map {:x 42}

(defc= e {:x a})          ;; cell with formula {:x a}, updated when a changes
(defc= f (+ a 1))         ;; cell with formula (+ a 1), updated when a changes
(defc= g (+ a ~(inc @a))) ;; cell with formula (+ a 43), updated when a changes
(defc= h [e f g])         ;; cell with formula [e f g], updated when e, f, or g change

@h                        ;;=> [{:x 42} 43 85]
(reset! a 7)              ;;=> 7
@h                        ;;=> [{:x 7} 8 50]
(swap! f inc)             ;;=> ERROR: f is a formula cell, it updates itself!
```

Note the use of `~` in the definition of `g`. The expression
`(inc @a)` is evaluated and the resulting value is used when creating
the formula, rather than being recomputed each time the cell updates.
See the [Formulas][9] section below.

Cells can be microbeasts...

```clojure
(defc test-results
  {:scores [74 51 97 88 89 91 72 77 69 72 45 63]
   :proctor "Mr. Smith"
   :subject "Organic Chemistry"
   :sequence "CHM2049"})

(defc= test-results-with-mean
  (let [scores (:scores test-results)
        mean   (/ (reduce + scores) (count scores))
        grade  (cond (<= 90 mean) :A
                     (<= 80 mean) :B
                     (<= 70 mean) :C
                     (<= 60 mean) :D
                     :else        :F)]
    (assoc test-results :mean mean :grade grade)))
```

## Formulas

All macros in formula expressions are fully expanded. The resulting
expression is then interpreted according to the following rules:

* **The unquote form** causes its argument to be evaluated in place
  and not walked.
* **The unquote-splicing form** is interpreted as the composition
  of `unquote` as above and `deref`.

Some things don't make sense in formulas and cause errors:

* **Unsupported forms** `def`, `ns`, `deftype*`, and `defrecord*`.
* **Circular dependencies** between cells result in infinite loops at
  runtime.

## Javelin API

Requiring the namespace and macros:

```clojure
(ns my-ns
  (:require
    [tailrecursion.javelin
     :refer [cell? input? cell set-cell! alts! destroy-cell! cell-map]])
  (:require-macros
    [tailrecursion.javelin
     :refer [cell= defc defc= set-cell!= cell-doseq]]))
```

API functions and macros:

```clojure
(cell? c)
;; Returns c if c is a Cell, nil otherwise.

(input? c)
;; Returns c if c is an input cell, nil otherwise.

(cell expr)
;; Create new input cell with initial value expr.

(cell= expr)
;; Create new fomula cell with formula expr.

(defc symbol doc-string? expr)
;; Creates a new input cell and binds it to a var with the name symbol and
;; the docstring doc-string if provided.

(defc= symbol doc-string? expr)
;; Creates a new formula cell and binds it to a var with the name symbol and
;; the docstring doc-string if provided.

(set-cell! c expr)
;; Convert c to input cell (if necessary) with value expr.

(set-cell!= c expr)
;; Convert c to formula cell (if necessary) with formula expr.

(destroy-cell! c)
;; Disconnects c from the propagation graph so it can be GC'd.

(alts! cs*)
;; Creates a formula cell whose value is a list of changed values in the cells cs.

(cell-map f c)
;; Given a cell c containing a seqable value of size n and a function f, returns
;; a sequence of n formula cells such that the ith cell's formula is (f (nth c i)).

(cell-let [binding-form c] body*)
;; Given a cell c and a binding form, binds names in the binding form to formula
;; cells containing the destructured values (these values will update as the
;; value of c changes) and evaluates the body expressions.

(cell-doseq seq-expr body*)
;; Repeatedly executes the body expression(s) for side effects as doseq does.
;; However seq-expr is a single binding-form/collection-cell-expr pair instead
;; of the multiple pairs allowed in doseq, and binding forms are bound to formula
;; cells containing the destructured values which will update as the collection
;; expr cell is changed.

(prop-cell prop-expr)
;; Returns a formula cell whose value is synced to the prop-expr, which is a
;; JavaScript property access expression, like (.-foo js/bar) for example.

(prop-cell prop-expr setter-cell callback?)
;; Given a property access expression (see above) prop-expr, a formula cell
;; setter-cell, and optionally a callback function, the JavaScript object
;; property specified by prop-expr is kept synced to the value in setter-cell
;; at all times. If the callback was provided it will be called whenever an
;; attempt is made to change the value of the property by means other than via
;; the setter-cell.
```
